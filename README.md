DNS-over-QUIC to UDP proxy and client implementation.

## License

This code is released under Apache License 2.0. You can find terms and

## Protocol compatibility

The DNS-over-QUIC implementation follows
[draft-huitema-quic-dnsoquic-06](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-huitema-quic-dnsoquic-06).

The QUIC protocol compatibility depends on the
[quic-go](https:///github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go) library.

## Getting started

Build the DoQ proxy and testing client.

```
go build ./cmd/proxy
go build ./cmd/client
```

Generate testing key and self-signed certificate for the proxy server.

```
openssl genpkey -algorithm EC -pkeyopt ec_paramgen_curve:P-256 -out key.pem
openssl req -x509 -days 30 -subj "/CN=DNS-over-QUIC Test" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1,IP:::1" -key key.pem -out cert.pem
```

Start the proxy. By default, the server loads the TLS key and certificate from
the files generated above, will use 8.8.4.4 (Google Public DNS) as a backend
server, and will listen on UDP port 784 (experimental port from the draft). Use
command line options to modify the default behavior. Notice the use of the
default port requries starting the proxy as superuser.

```
sudo ./proxy
```

Query the proxy using the testing utility. The client establishes a QUIC session
to the server and sends each query via a dedicated stream. The replies are printed
in the order of completion:

```
./client ns1.com A ns1.com AAAA
```
```

# Troubleshooting

Note that this is an experimental code built on top of an experimental protocol.

The server and client in this repository use the same QUIC library
and therefore they should be compatible. However, if a different client is
used, the handshake may fail on the version negotiation. We suggest to check
packet capture first when the client is unable to connect.

The proxy also logs information about accepted connections and streams which
can be used to inspect the sequence of events:

```
$ sudo ./proxy -listen 127.0.0.1:784 -cert cert.pem -key key.pem -udp_backend 8.8.4.4:53
ts=2019-03-24T10:31:32.408891Z msg="listening for clients" addr=127.0.0.1:784
